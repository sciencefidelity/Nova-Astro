As always credit goes to [@apexskier](https://github.com/apexskier) for making the great [TypeScript](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript) extension and utils. Thanks to the Astro team for their work on the [Astro Language Server and VSCode extension](https://github.com/withastro/language-tools), and to Nova for their built in syntaxes that I have wholehartedly copied.
